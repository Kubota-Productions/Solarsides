_____
1.1.0
Minor patch and UX improvement

Added:
• Undo/redo support.
• A user action is now required with an editor popup window to confirm if a new CrushCamera should be instantiated when the reference is not valid.
• Foliage shaders (global shader properties) are now automatically initialized after Unity starts.

Changed:
• Rename VFXSetWindData to VFXSetWindProperties and improve the component flexibility.
• Rename the Eole toolbar script namespace.
• Delete GlobalShaderFoliageManager and its custom inspector script, as they were not used.

Fixed:
